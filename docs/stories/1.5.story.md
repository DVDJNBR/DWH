# Story 1.5: Finalize GDPR Compliance Documentation

**Status**: Draft

**Epic**: B3 Certification Compliance
**Story Statement**:
As a compliance officer,
I want a formal GDPR register and associated procedures to be documented,
so that the project's data management is compliant with C16.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1.  A `docs/gdpr_compliance.md` file is created.
2.  The document details all Personal Identifiable Information (PII) processed by the system.
3.  The document outlines procedures for data access, rectification, and erasure.

## Dev Notes
*CRITICAL: This section MUST contain ONLY information extracted from architecture documents. NEVER invent or assume technical details.*

### GDPR & Access Control
*   **C16 (Management/RGPD)**: This competency explicitly includes GDPR. [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#Impact Analysis (B3 Certification Focus)]
*   **Row-Level Security (RLS)**: RLS is essential for C16 (access control) and is currently being integrated for multi-vendor isolation. This is directly relevant to GDPR's access control requirements. [Source: brownfield-architecture.md#Technical Debt and Known Issues]

## Tasks / Subtasks
*Generate detailed, sequential list of technical tasks based ONLY on: Epic Requirements, Story AC, Reviewed Architecture Information*

- [ ] **Analyze existing data flows**: Identify all data sources and sinks within the DWH project, especially where Personal Identifiable Information (PII) might be present.
- [ ] **Identify PII**: Detail which specific data points within the DWH are considered PII (e.g., `dim_customer.email`, `dim_customer.name`).
- [ ] **Review RLS implementation**: Understand the current state of Row-Level Security and how it contributes to access control for PII.
- [ ] **Create `docs/gdpr_compliance.md`**: Draft the initial document structure, including sections for:
    *   Introduction and Scope
    *   Data Inventory (PII types, storage locations, processing purposes)
    *   Data Subject Rights (Access, Rectification, Erasure - procedures for each)
    *   Data Security Measures (Referencing RLS, encryption, access controls)
    *   Data Retention Policies
    *   Incident Response Plan (brief overview) (AC: 1)
- [ ] **Populate `docs/gdpr_compliance.md` with PII details**: Document all identified PII and where it is processed/stored. (AC: 2)
- [ ] **Outline procedures for data subject rights**: Detail the steps for data access, rectification, and erasure requests. (AC: 3)
- [ ] **Review `docs/gdpr_compliance.md`**: Ensure accuracy and completeness, especially regarding current RLS implementation.
- [ ] **Conduct peer review of documentation**: (Optional, but recommended) Get another agent or user to review the GDPR document.
